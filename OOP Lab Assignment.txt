Assingnment 2

1) Define a class ArrayList and its  members are :
	a)variables:
		i) int arr[] reference variable
		ii)int size
	both variable members are static.
	b) Create a static block  which initializes the size if the array and reserves space for array.
	c)Define static method for following operations
		i) input() for filloinf array
		ii) output() displaying elements in array
		iii) search() for searching an item in array
		iv) Sort() for arranging all element in array in ascending order.
	Define a class ArrayDemo which contains main() which can access all the methods defined in Arraylist class.
	Write a menu driven program
	1)input
	2)output
	3)search
	4)Sort
	0)exit	
2) Define a class StackList which contains following variables and methods. All variables and methods are non static.
   variables are: top, size & st[]
   methods are: 
	i) set() which initializes top,size and st
	ii) push()
	iii)pop()
	iv)display()
	Now create a another class stackaDemo which contains main(). the main() access all these methods defined in StackList.
	Write a menu driven program to implement the following operations -
	1) push()
	2) pop()
	3)display()
	0)exit	

Assignment 3:
	Define a class pattern in c++.
	Data members in pattern class is :-
	a. n= number of lines.
	Methods/patterns in class are:
	a. set() to initialize the value of n
	b. pattern() prints the following 3 patterns in a menu driven program:
	*
	**
	***
	****
	.
	.
	.

	*
	* *
	* * *
	* * * *
	.
	.
	.

	*
	* *
	* * *
	* *
	*
	Write a menu driven program to do the following operations:-
	INPUT | OPERATION
	1       pattern1()
	2       pattern2()
	3       pattern3()
	0       exit
Assignment 4:
1)	Overload  "+" & "*" operators  for matrix addition and multiplication when each matrix is an object userdefined class  "Matrix"
2)	Overload  "+" & "*" operators  for matrix addition and multiplication using friend functions when each matrix is an object userdefined class  "Matrix"

	Friend function:-
	It is a non member function which can access the private members defined in class which it is friend.
Assignment 5:

1)  Create a class student attrubutes are name roll & average marks (all are private)
	Create another class studentlist attributes are 
		1) List[] of array of student class
		2) size -> no of student object
	Methods are
		1) input() -> storing details of all student rrecord
		2) output()
		3) search() -> base on roll number
		4) sort all records according to their name
		5) add()
		6) remove()

Assignment 6:

1) 	Define a class Employee. The attributes are
		1)Name
		2)Age
		3)Salary
	Define a class Employee_list that contains a set of methods operate this variable like 
		display all records
		search a particular record
		initialize all records etc
	Here all employee records should be maintained by linked list

Assignment 7:
1)	Define a class student. The attributes are:
		1)Name
		2)Roll
		3)dept
		4)avgmarks 
	and methods are
		1)constructor
		2)add
		3)show
		4)remove
		5)search
	Now define 3 classes extends student class the subclass are:
	CSE_list, IT_List, ECE_list
	Each of these classes contains a list of student objects.

	1)	Write a java to implement multiple inheritance.
	2)	Write a program to display different types of access control in opp.
25/11/2022
	1) 	Define the following two classes in package p1:-
		a. Array class- input(), output().
		b. Linked list class- create(), display().
		Use array class and linked list class from different packages.
	2)	Define user defined exception classes:
		a. OverflowException.
		b. UnderflowException.
		Define push() and pop(). When the arrray representation of stack is overflow, then push() throws OverflowExceptionObject
		and when stack is underflow then pop() throws UnderflowExceptionObject.

	1)Create multi-threads to :
		1)generate all even number b/w 1 to n.
		2)generate all odd number b/w 1 to n.
		3)generate all n fibonacci numbers.
		4)generate all prime numbers b/w 1 to n.
	2)Implement thread synchronization.
	3)Implement producer and consumer problem.
